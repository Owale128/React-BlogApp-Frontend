# My very first react application - Frontend ðŸ˜ƒ


My project is a blogging platform that I've built using React. I've created various components to manage different aspects of the blog, including adding, editing, and deleting posts. I utilize different React hooks to manage state and effects, and I integrate sound notifications to provide feedback to the user on different events. Additionally, I have created a backend server connected to a MongoDB database to handle data management operations. The styling rules are customized using CSS to provide visually appealing and responsive design. Overall, my project is a comprehensive solution for creating and managing blog posts in a user-friendly environment.
